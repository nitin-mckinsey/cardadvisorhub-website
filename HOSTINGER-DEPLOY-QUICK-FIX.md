# Quick Hostinger Deployment Guide

## Current Situation
- Your files are pushed to GitHub ✅
- Your webhook is configured ✅ 
- But deployment scripts need to be ON your Hostinger server ❌

## Immediate Solutions

### Option A: Manual File Upload (Fastest)
1. Download these files from your repository:
   - `hostinger-webhook-deploy.sh`
   - `webhook-deploy.php`
2. Upload to Hostinger File Manager → public_html
3. Set permissions via File Manager or SSH

### Option B: Use Hostinger's Git Deploy Feature
1. In Hostinger panel, go to **Git** section
2. If available, clone your repository directly
3. This will sync all files including scripts

### Option C: SSH Access (If Available)
If your Hostinger plan includes SSH:

```bash
# SSH into your Hostinger server
ssh username@your-server.com

# Navigate to your website directory
cd public_html

# Clone or pull your repository
git pull origin main

# Make script executable
chmod +x hostinger-webhook-deploy.sh
```

## Quick Test Commands for Hostinger

Once files are on your server, test with:

```bash
# Check if files exist
ls -la *.sh *.php

# Test the deployment script
bash hostinger-webhook-deploy.sh

# Check webhook endpoint
curl -X POST https://yourdomain.com/webhook-deploy.php
```

## File Locations Needed on Hostinger Server:
- `/public_html/webhook-deploy.php` (webhook receiver)
- `/public_html/hostinger-webhook-deploy.sh` (deployment script)
- Both files must be in your website's root directory

## Next Steps:
1. Upload the deployment files to Hostinger
2. Test the webhook by pushing a small change to GitHub  
3. Check webhook-deploy.log for results
