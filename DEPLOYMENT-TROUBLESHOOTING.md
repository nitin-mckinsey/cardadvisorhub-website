# Hostinger Deployment Troubleshooting Guide

## 🔍 Why Files Aren't Updating on Hostinger

### Current Status Check:
- ✅ Git commits are working (latest: test, 500 error fix, etc.)
- ✅ Local repository is clean and up to date
- ❓ Hostinger auto-deployment may have issues

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting Steps:

### Step 1: Check Hostinger Git Deployment Status
1. **Login to Hostinger Control Panel**
   - Go to: https://hpanel.hostinger.com
   - Navigate to: Website → [cardadvisorhub.com] → Git Repository

2. **Check Deployment Logs**
   - Look for deployment history/logs
   - Check if latest commits show up
   - Look for any error messages

3. **Verify Webhook Status**
   - Check if webhook is still active
   - Webhook URL: `https://webhooks.hostinger.com/deploy/b389530323348f25ed5d5ca482a5877b`

### Step 2: Check GitHub Webhook Status
1. **Go to GitHub Repository**
   - Repository Settings → Webhooks
   - Check webhook status (should have green checkmark ✅)
   - Click on webhook to see recent deliveries
   - Look for failed deliveries (red X ❌)

### Step 3: Manual Deployment Trigger
If auto-deployment isn't working, try manual deployment:

1. **In Hostinger Git Manager:**
   - Find "Deploy" or "Pull Changes" button
   - Click to manually trigger deployment
   - Wait for completion

### Step 4: Alternative Solutions

#### Option A: SFTP Sync (Quick Fix)
```powershell
# Use VS Code SFTP to sync manually
# Ctrl+Shift+P → "SFTP: Sync Local -> Remote"
```

#### Option B: Manual File Upload
1. Go to Hostinger File Manager
2. Navigate to `/public_html/`
3. Upload the updated files manually

#### Option C: Deployment Path Issue
The deployment might be going to wrong directory:
- Check if deployment path is `/public_html/` 
- Or should it be `/public_html/wp-content/themes/genesis-sample/`?

### Step 5: Force Push Test
```powershell
# Make a small test change to force deployment
echo "# Deployment test $(Get-Date)" >> deployment-test.txt
git add deployment-test.txt
git commit -m "Test: Force deployment trigger"
git push origin main
```

## 🔧 Common Issues & Fixes:

### Issue 1: Webhook Not Configured
**Solution:** Re-add webhook in GitHub:
- Payload URL: `https://webhooks.hostinger.com/deploy/b389530323348f25ed5d5ca482a5877b`
- Content-type: `application/json`
- Events: Just push events

### Issue 2: Wrong Deployment Path
**Solution:** Verify in Hostinger Git settings:
- Path should be `/public_html/` for full site
- Or `/public_html/wp-content/themes/genesis-sample/` for theme only

### Issue 3: Git Service Down
**Solution:** Check Hostinger status or contact support

### Issue 4: Repository Permissions
**Solution:** Ensure repository is public or SSH keys are configured

## 📞 Next Steps:
1. Check Hostinger deployment logs first
2. Verify GitHub webhook deliveries  
3. Try manual deployment in Hostinger
4. Contact Hostinger support if issue persists

## 🚨 Emergency Workaround:
If you need immediate deployment, use SFTP:
```
VS Code → Command Palette → SFTP: Sync Local -> Remote
```
